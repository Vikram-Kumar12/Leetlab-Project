# 1. After user verify they redirect my website login page.
- Agr aap chahte ho ki verify hone ke baad user ko automatically frontend ke signin page (http://localhost:5173/signin) par redirect kar diya jaye.
- Iske liye tumhe backend mein verify controller ke response ko modify karna padega. 
- Agar tum Express.js use kar rahe ho (Node.js backend), toh res.redirect() ka use kar sakte ho.
- // âœ… Redirect to frontend login page
- ***return res.redirect("http://localhost:5173/signin");***


1. Today, when I was trying to create a problem, I was getting a 500 error because I hadn't started Judge0. Okay.
So, here's my doubt:
2. I currently don't have a domain, but I want to deploy both the frontend and backend of the LeetLab project on Vercel.
3. But after deployment, if an Admin creates a problem, I don't understand how the code will be executed on Judge0. Can someone explain that?
